# Information:
  Work in progress.


# Player:

 * Character3D
   * Script
 * Skeleton Mesh
    * bone attachment component
    * Mesh
 * State Machine
   * Idle
   * Air
   * Run
   * Ladder
  * Tools / Weapon
    * script

 There are two or three way to script to handle weapons or tools. But it required to handle animation from the player character builds.

 One is animation finish and play check conditions.

 Just thinking of using the remote attachment to handle script pathing.
