# Information:

```
int get_multiplayer_authority ( ) const
bool is_multiplayer_authority ( ) const
void set_multiplayer_authority ( int id, bool recursive=true )

```
 * authority over the node on the network
 * ultimately defaults to peer ID 1 (the server)

To set peer client set_multiplayer_authority for access their player character.

```
EnumerationsÂ¶
enum RPCMode:

RPCMode RPC_MODE_DISABLED = 0

Used with Node.rpc_config to disable a method or property for all RPC calls, making it unavailable. Default for all methods.

RPCMode RPC_MODE_ANY_PEER = 1

Used with Node.rpc_config to set a method to be callable remotely by any peer. Analogous to the @rpc("any_peer") annotation. Calls are accepted from all remote peers, no matter if they are node's authority or not.

RPCMode RPC_MODE_AUTHORITY = 2

Used with Node.rpc_config to set a method to be callable remotely only by the current multiplayer authority (which is the server by default). Analogous to the @rpc("authority") annotation. See Node.set_multiplayer_authority.


```






 
```
set_multiplayer_authority(str(name).to_int())

if not is_multiplayer_authority(): return



if not is_multiplayer_authority(): return

hit_player.get_multiplayer_authority()
```


```
Need to set ID authority for client.
```

Initializing as a server, listening on the given port, with a given maximum number of peers:
```gd
var peer = NetworkedMultiplayerENet.new()
peer.create_server(SERVER_PORT, MAX_PLAYERS)
get_tree().network_peer = peer
```
Initializing as a client, connecting to a given IP and port:
```
var peer = NetworkedMultiplayerENet.new()
peer.create_client(SERVER_IP, SERVER_PORT)
get_tree().network_peer = peer
```


Get the previously set network peer:
```
get_tree().get_network_peer()1
```
Checking whether the tree is initialized as a server or client:
```
get_tree().is_network_server()
```
Terminating the networking feature:
```
get_tree().network_peer = null
```

Server and Clients:
```
network_peer_connected(int id)
network_peer_disconnected(int id)
```


## RPC
To communicate between peers, the easiest way is to use RPCs (remote procedure calls). This is implemented as a set of functions in Node:
```
rpc("function_name", <optional_args>)

rpc_id(<peer_id>,"function_name", <optional_args>)

rpc_unreliable("function_name", <optional_args>)

rpc_unreliable_id(<peer_id>, "function_name", <optional_args>)
```

## Back to lobby:

```py
# Typical lobby implementation; imagine this being in /root/lobby.

extends Node

# Connect all functions

func _ready():
    get_tree().network_peer_connected.connect(_player_connected)
    get_tree().network_peer_disconnected.connect(_player_disconnected)
    get_tree().connected_to_server.connect(_connected_ok)
    get_tree().connection_failed.connect(_connected_fail)
    get_tree().server_disconnected.connect(_server_disconnected)

# Player info, associate ID to data
var player_info = {}
# Info we send to other players
var my_info = { name = "Johnson Magenta", favorite_color = Color8(255, 0, 255) }

func _player_connected(id):
    # Called on both clients and server when a peer connects. Send my info to it.
    rpc_id(id, "register_player", my_info)

func _player_disconnected(id):
    player_info.erase(id) # Erase player from info.

func _connected_ok():
    pass # Only called on clients, not server. Will go unused; not useful here.

func _server_disconnected():
    pass # Server kicked us; show error and abort.

func _connected_fail():
    pass # Could not even connect to server; abort.

remote func register_player(info):
    # Get the id of the RPC sender.
    var id = get_tree().get_rpc_sender_id()
    # Store the info
    player_info[id] = info

    # Call function to update lobby UI here
```
